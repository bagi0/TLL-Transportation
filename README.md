I have designed and developed a sophisticated web application tailored to meet the complex demands of the Bus Transportation System in Tallinn, Estonia. This cutting-edge application empowers end-users with the capability to seamlessly access and monitor the real-time whereabouts of an array of transportation modes, encompassing buses, trams, and trolley-buses.

The core of this system harnesses the prowess of PHP scripting to seamlessly interact with a dynamic public API, facilitating the extraction and processing of real-time data. This meticulously crafted PHP code operates as the linchpin for data aggregation and dissemination.

Our frontend prowess further unfolds through the implementation of JavaScript, serving as the vessel through which we orchestrate the visualization and presentation of the precise geographic coordinates of these moving assets. These geographical data points are ingeniously rendered onto an interactive map, offering users an engaging and informative visual representation of the transportation network.

In terms of web structure, we employ HTML to meticulously craft the underlying framework, ensuring an elegant and well-organized digital presence. CSS takes center stage to bestow an aesthetically refined and intuitively navigable interface upon our application, thereby enriching the user experience.

The heart of our application's functionality and data management resides in a sophisticated backend powered by the robust combination of MySQL and PHP. This dynamic duo oversees the critical task of user authentication. To access the full spectrum of application features, users are seamlessly guided through a process of initial registration, followed by secure login credentials verification.

The cumulative result of these technical intricacies culminates in a seamless and futuristic user experience, allowing customers to stay abreast of the latest transportation schedules and routes with unparalleled precision. In essence, our system functions as an indispensable tool, elevating the efficiency and convenience of public transportation in Tallinn, Estonia, by delivering real-time insights and enhancing overall commuter satisfaction.
